				appropriate name: i.e. if you are translating to French you will need to name the directory FR
				<br>
				The first thing is to define the characters encoding your language requires at the top of the messages file.
				The variable you must edit is <i>\$CHARSET</i>. UTF-8 encoding should work with almost all the languages.<br>
				Next you'll have to define the document reading direction. The variable to modify is <i>\$DOCDIR</i>
				and can have two possible values:
				<ul>
				<li><b>ltr</b> (left-to-right): this is the default and means the text must be read from left to right
				<li><b>rtl</b> (right-to-left): means the text must be read from right to left (i.e. Arabian, Hebrew, etc)
				</ul>
				Once changed <i>\$CHARSET</i> and <i>\$DOCDIR</i> according to the language you are translating into,
				 you will have to translate all the error messages and user interface messages contained in the messages file.
				
				<li>You will then need the flag(s) GIFs for the languages you are going to use, in the language/flags directory. 
				Get the flag(s) you need and change the file name(s) to be XX.gif, where XX is the language code for your country language.
				<br>Copy the renamed flag file(s) in the language/flags/ directory.
				<br><b>Note:</b> for each translation, you need the corresponding XX.gif file in language/flags/
